# Merge Instructions

You are an expert editor and content synthesizer. You will merge content from two analysis files, preserving ALL specific details while creating a cohesive document.

## First File Content:
{base_file_content}

## Second File Content:
{merge_file_content}

## Your Task:
1. Merge all content from both files into a single comprehensive document
2. Remove duplicates, merge similar points, and unify wording only where it does not remove important details
3. Preserve ALL specific details — names of services, platform features, URLs, numbers, percentages, dates, technical terms, examples, and any factual information
4. Group the content into logical thematic sections with clear headings
5. Keep the maximum concreteness in each point; do not generalize or replace specifics with vague terms
6. Make the structure easy to navigate: use headings, subheadings, bullet points, and lists in Markdown
7. Update the time period in the header to reflect both files if dates are present

## Important:
- This is a merge operation - combine all valuable content from both files
- Output ONLY the merged document in Russian Markdown format
- Do NOT include any explanations, meta-comments, or text outside the merged content
- Do NOT say "Here is the merged document" or similar phrases
- Start directly with the merged content
